    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>I was born in Los Angeles, but spent my childhood growing up in beautiful Bellingham, Washington. As a kid I pursued a variety of subjects, excelling in everything from filmmaking to 3D modeling. Currently, I'm working to earn a BS in Informatics from the University of Washington, with a focus on Human Computer Interaction.</p>
